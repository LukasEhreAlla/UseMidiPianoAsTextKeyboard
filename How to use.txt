Install python and pip install nessasary packages (mido, tkinter, keyboard)
Figure out Names of Buttons on Text Keyboard by using "TestButtonName.py" (Keys like Shift may differ depending on OS-language)
Write Button Name at right place (behind "Button:" in Quotation Marks) into "Keybinds.json" to use Midi Piano as Computer Text Keyboard 
Start any of the .py files (for Example "Main.py" or "Note.py" to start the programm) 
 If you have multiply midi devices, the code should always choose the first one it finds
 If you want to use something weird that mido puts on num 0-20 u need to add these yourself in Keybinds.json with "num": (...)
Info: Wanted to add a lot more features but got lazy and put finishing this off for months, so code is very messy and largely unorganised, even i dont understand what is going on there
